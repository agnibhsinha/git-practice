Good morning Sir,

First of all I would like to thank you, for giving me an opportunity to introduce myself.

I am Agnibh Sinha, I am from West Bengal.

I belong from a nuclear family. By profession my father is an electrician and my loveable mother is a home-maker.

I am pursuing my under graduation in Computer Science Engineering  from Templecity Institute of Technology and Engineering .

I have completed my Intermediate in the year of 2015 with 79.4%  & High Secondary in the year of 2017 with 77.4% of marks.

Photography is my passion. Besides this I also prefer to travel and listening music. 

Taking independent step in work is one of my biggest strength. Moreover than I’m good in leadership and I can handle any kind of situations with a helpful tendency.

I’m not comfortable until I can’t finish my work within given time and that is my weakness.

I would say my short term goal is to get selected in a company like yours, where I can give my best  for the organization growth.

In my long term goal I would like to be the CEO of an MNC. 
	
Within the span of  5 years I would like to see myself in IBM as senior developer.

That's all about me.

Thank you very much for giving a great opportunity to introduce myself to you.
